	<li> Keep a backup of the original file; if you want to deactivate all functionalities of this panel for Bind, you can revert to the old file. If you've made any changes to this relevant file during the setup, adjust this setting accordingly. However, this setting is suited for a default configuration and installation. It is not advisable to alter this unless necessary. Modify your /etc/bind/named.conf file to match the following content (nothing more) <font color="red">(remove any existing content!)</font>:<br /><br /> include "/etc/bind/dnshttp/dnshttp.named.conf";<br /><br /> </li>
	<li>With these steps completed, you are now prepared to utilize all the functionalities of this software! There's no need to manually set up MySQL tables; the software will handle this during installation. You can now log in at the domain where your website is deployed...</li>
</ul>




<h2 id="installcron">Rollback</h2>
As described in the installation steps, you changed file named.conf. You shall have made a backup like described in the Installation steps. If you replace your named.conf with your old initial backuped-file - All Changes made by DNSHTTP to your Bind9 Instance will be gone. This is a simple but trustfull way to "hard" deactivate and activate this software connection with bind. 
<h2 id="installcron">Setting Up Cronjobs</h2>

<h2 id="passlost">Caution to Prevent Password Loss</h2>
<p>It's important to exercise caution in safeguarding your password as there's no straightforward means of restoring it in the event of loss.<br />
If you lose your administrator password without access to a user with user management permissions, you'll need to reset the users table. This can be accomplished by entering your MySQL server and deleting the dnshttp_user table. Upon visiting the page thereafter, the table will be restored with the original login information as indicated below.<br /><br /><b class="orangetext">If you wish to avoid deleting the users table</b>:</p>
<p>If your admin password is lost and you lack another administrative account for user management, the only available recourse is manual password alteration within the database. Refer to the users table and replace the string in the password field with a new bcrypt PHP string containing your new password. Online tools are available for generating these strings.<br /><br />Deleting the table will result in the removal of all users. However, the password and administrative user will be reset to the default login credentials provided at the end of the readme. This offers a simpler solution if retaining the users table isn't essential.<br /><br />The web interface does not include a password restoration function and such functionality is not planned. However, you can modify account passwords if you are able to log in.</p>

<div class="internal_show" id="show_f">
<h2 id="repinfods">Informations About Domains and Replications</h2>
Here you can see more detailed informations about the Replications and Domains...


<h2 id="repinfo">Domains, Replications and Conflicts</h2>
You can see replicated Domains in the Domains->Slave Domains Section. There are all domains which have been copied from other dns servers, which are registered in the Replication->Manage DNS Servers Area! The data in the interface you see may outdated. It updates every time the cronjob dies execute, you will see the last time of execution on top of the domain pages. There are a lot of icons which describe the status of servers or domains, you can see what the icons mean below in the icon description area!<br /><br />
If you visit the Replication Area you will be able to get access to the API Logfile, the Replication Logfile and the DNS Server Manager. You can get informations how to set up a DNS Server Connection below. The API Logfile Serves as Log for Requests to and from this server to other dns servers. This log may not be fully reliable, cos not all areas are covered, to prevent useless database storage beeing used by this logs. In some cases, if there are errors, you may get more insights in that area about this area. Entries are marked with [in] or [out]. [in] describes an incoming request, to this server. [out] defines an outgoing request to another server.<br /><br />

Within the Domain section, you gain visibility into domains that have undergone replication or have been fetched locally. The Master Domains section specifically presents domains that have been locally fetched. Domains in this section are inherently treated as master domains. It's important to adhere to the guideline of refraining from registering other slave domains locally. The software's framework anticipates that exclusively master domains are configured within the local servers' named.conf.local and named.conf.default-zones (or the designated file stipulated in settings.php). This configuration is suitable for the majority of setups, especially when employing this software for replication purposes. The fetched local Master Domains, which potentially can be replicated to other servers, can be comprehensively reviewed in the Domain->Master Domains Section, complete with their respective statuses. Further elucidation of the icons can be found in the documentation.<br /><br />

Within the Domains section, you'll find a button labeled "Slave Domains." Clicking on this button will reveal a list of domains that have been sourced from other DNS Servers. For more comprehensive insights into the various status icons, detailed information can be found in the documentation.<br /><br />

Conflicts may arise in scenarios where a domain exists both as a master domain on the local server and as a slave domain on a remote server, or if two slave servers provide the same master domain. In such cases, these conflicts are highlighted within the dedicated "Conflicts" Section. To address conflicts, you have the option to give preference to a particular domain in either the Domain->Master Domains or Domain->Slave Domains section. This chosen domain then takes precedence in conflict situations. Failing to resolve a conflict will result in the domain not being registered in the local bind instance. Therefore, resolving conflicts becomes essential for maintaining domain activity. The conflicts section primarily serves as an overview of conflicts, their resolutions, and the affected servers—the origins of the conflicts. Conflicts can be resolved by designating a preferred domain. Unsolved conflicts are marked in yellow, whereas resolved conflicts are indicated in green.<br /><br />

It's important to highlight that local Master domains are inherently preferred by default. This preference mechanism serves to safeguard against conflicts that could lead to slave servers inadvertently deregistering domains.
<h2 id="repcon">Replication Logfile</h2>
Contained within the Replication Logfile is a comprehensive record of the entire replication process, meticulously orchestrated by the cronjob sync.php. This logfile serves as a repository of the intricacies involved in the executed operations. While much of this information is accessible through the user interface (UI) and does not necessarily require direct inspection of the log files, delving into the Replication Logfile can prove immensely valuable when troubleshooting errors or conducting in-depth analysis.

<h2 id="repcon">Domain Detail View</h2>
While navigating the Domains Section's Domains Overview, you have the ability to inspect the zonedata for domains that have been fetched either externally through replication or locally. Should any errors manifest within the zonedata, these are visually indicated by an icon. To gain further insights into these errors, the "Details" button window provides access to the output of the named-zonecheck command. Within this window, you'll find supplementary information regarding the domain and any errors that might have arisen during the execution of sync.php. This background process orchestrates various tasks and operations.

<h2 id="repcon">Authenticity of the Webinterface</h2>
It's important to note that updates to the Domain Section exclusively occur during the operation of the cronjob sync.php. At the uppermost part of the page, the date and time of the most recent data update are displayed in green. To initiate a data update, you have the option to manually execute sync.php or alternatively, you can await the completion of the next scheduled cronjob cycle for automatic updates. (For further guidance, refer to the "Installation" section.)

<h2 id="repcon">Types of Server Connections</h2>
In scenarios where a system comprises dedicated Master Domains and Slave Servers, deploying this software on both servers is recommended. On the Master server, the Slave Server should be configured, designating it as such within the software. This entails specifying the relevant website URL where the panel is hosted, ensuring an identical token to the counterpart server, and providing the external server's IP address. It is crucial that this external IP address is valid, as the replication process hinges on this. At least one functional IPv4 or IPv6 address is necessary for the other nameserver's accessibility.<br /><br />

Concurrently, on the Slave Server, the installation of the panel is also required. Here, the Master server should be set up within the Replication->Manage DNS Server Area. The status icons indicating the feasibility of the connection can be observed, with detailed explanations available in the documentation.<br /><br />

Furthermore, the software accommodates "hybrid" connections, wherein each server equipped with this panel can function as both a slave and a master server simultaneously. This configuration proves advantageous, and the conflict section proves particularly useful in these setups.<br /><br />

<h2 id="repcon">Domain Settings will not Sync</h2>
When establishing a Slave/Master Server connection, it's important to note that certain settings pertaining to domain preferences or replication blocking will not be synchronized between the servers. If you wish to prioritize a domain on two Master servers, you must individually configure the preference on each respective Master server. It's crucial to understand that the replication process exclusively involves the synchronization of domains and the content within these domains. Specifically, the replication covers the domain name itself, without encompassing any additional settings or attributes associated with it.
<h2 id="reptok">Server Tokens</h2>
For seamless server communication and successful replication processes, it's imperative to ensure uniformity in the tokens used for server connections. To illustrate, if Server 1 utilizes a token "123," it is essential that the exact same token "123" is configured on Server 2 as well. This consistency in tokens serves as a fundamental requirement for the effective operation of replication processes and other API requests. It's advisable to verify that the chosen token intended for replication exists identically on both servers, thus facilitating smooth and uninterrupted communication between them.
<h2 id="disable-repdomain">Disable Replication for Master/User Domains</h2>
<p>Within the web interface, there is a functionality that allows you to selectively disable the replication of specific master domains to slave servers. This means you can control and prevent the propagation of certain master domains to slave servers, offering a higher degree of flexibility and customization in your DNS management setup.</p>
<h2 id="repzc">Zone Checks</h2>
Every zone file which will be used, will checked with the command named-checkzone before it gets written for the configuration. If that command fails, the last working file gets in affect. If there is no working file the domain will not be active. You will get notification icons on that domain for every case. Look at the status icon information below in the documentation to get informations about this status icons. If a Zone is Using its fallback zonefile, or failing verifying the new file, you can get the error string of "named-checkzone" in the domains details section.
<h2 id="debuginfo">MySQL Debugging for Developers</h2>
<p>For those engaged in development or seeking to modify the software, the activation of the mysql_debugging mode within the settings.php file provides a valuable tool. This mode enables the appearance of the "debug" section, allowing for the observation of MySQL errors, should they arise. It's crucial to note that this section is primarily intended for developers, as the software has undergone comprehensive testing, rendering this feature largely superfluous for regular users. It's important to emphasize that this section exclusively displays MySQL errors and doesn't provide insights into replication or other functionalities. In instances where MySQL errors do occur, particularly during table structure regeneration, there's no need for undue concern, as these errors are likely to self-correct over time.</p>
